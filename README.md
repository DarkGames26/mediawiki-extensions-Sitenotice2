</div>

## üöÄ Installation
1. [Download](https://github.com/DarkGames26/mediawiki-extensions-Sitenotice2/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) place the file(s) in a directory called `Sitenotice2` in your `extensions/` folder.
2. Add the following code at the bottom of your LocalSettings.php:
```php
wfLoadExtension( 'Sitenotice2' );
```
3. **‚úîÔ∏èDone** - Navigate to Special:Version on your wiki to verify that the extension is successfully installed.

### üëÄ Notes
‚ö†Ô∏è This extension should not be used with DismissableSiteNotice. It was created based on that extension, so it has all the functionality that DismissableSiteNotice already had.

## üßû Configurations
**Available configurations**

| ‚öôÔ∏è | Name | Description | Values | Default
:--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :---
| ‚öôÔ∏è | `$wgDismissableSiteNoticeForAnons` | This allows to set whether or not it should be possible for anonymous visitors of the wiki to dismiss the sitenotice shown. Available for MW 1.25 + | `true` or `false` | `true`
| ‚öôÔ∏è | `$wgMajorSiteNoticeID` | Integer. The value is stored inside a cookie. When a user decides to close the sitenotice, the current value of `$wgMajorSiteNoticeID` is saved as well and the closed notice is not shown again. `$wgMajorSiteNoticeID` now can be incremented when a new text is set up as sitenotice. If `$wgMajorSiteNoticeID` has inbetween been incremented, then the sitenotice is shown again, even if the user closed an older sitenotice before. | `true` or `false` | `0`

## üïπÔ∏è Usage
When you add a new sitenotice and want everyone to see it, change the number on the created page "MediaWiki:Sitenotice id" by one (e.g. if it would be 5, you'd replace the page with the number 6 and so on).

The extension behavior is that it will remember the dismissal by the user and only reset after the number in MediaWiki:Sitenotice_id has been raised. This allows a wiki to make minor updates to a notice without causing it to show again for everybody.
